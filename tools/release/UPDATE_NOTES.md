# Finest Hour Remastered: latest update

The latest fixes for Finest Hour Remastered 1.0, all in one small program. It is cumulative: it updates any earlier
installation of 1.0 to the latest version, whichever version it has now. Your settings (`codfh.toml`) and saved
games are kept.

New installations do not need it: the installer on the [1.0 release](https://github.com/crazyriddler/FinestHourRemastered/releases/tag/v1.0)
always carries the latest update and installs it with the game.

## How to update
1. Download `FinestHourRemasteredUpdate.exe`.
2. Run it and choose the folder where Finest Hour Remastered is installed, then **Update**.

The version installed is in `version.txt` beside the game. Unattended:
`FinestHourRemasteredUpdate.exe --update "C:\Games\Finest Hour Remastered" --log update.log` (exit code 0 updated,
1 failed).

## Changes since 1.0
- The world's animated textures now move, as their artists made them: the light caustics on the sewer walls, the
  falling water, the Volga and the rivers, glowing coals, fans and more. The game always ran these animations, but
  RenderWare drew those surfaces without them: their sectors never had the material effects turned on.
- Level 4 (the sewers): the white disc under the pipe's splash and the white layer over the waterfall are gone; a
  texture stage that reads no texture now reads black, as on the console.
- The installer and the updater speak English, French, Italian and Spanish (the system's language), and a new
  installation starts the game in the system's language when it is one of the game's four (English otherwise).
